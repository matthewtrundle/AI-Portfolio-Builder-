## Usage Tips

1. **Batch Generation**: Generate 4 variations of each prompt using `--repeat 4`
2. **Upscaling**: Always upscale to max quality for web use
3. **Consistency**: Use same `--seed` number across related images
4. **File Formats**: Export as WebP for optimal web performance
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure good contrast ratios with text overlays

## Image Placement Guide

- **Hero Section**: Use image 1 or 2 as full-width background with overlay
- **Problem Cards**: Images 3 & 4 as card backgrounds or side illustrations
- **How It Works**: Images 5, 6, 7 as step illustrations
- **Testimonials**: Image 8 as background texture, image 9 for diversity
- **CTA Section**: Image 10 as dramatic full-width background
