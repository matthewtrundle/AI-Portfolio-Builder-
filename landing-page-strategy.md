## Landing Page Structure & Sections

### 1. Hero Section
**Purpose:** Immediately capture attention and communicate the core value proposition

**Structure:**
- Headline: "Your Resume is Dead. Long Live Your AI Portfolio."
- Subheadline: "In the age of AI screening, stand out with a dynamic portfolio that showcases your real impactâ€”not just keywords."
- CTA Button: "Build My Portfolio in 5 Minutes" (bright, contrasting color)
- Trust indicators: "Join 10,000+ professionals who've ditched resumes"

**Key Messaging:**
```
Headline variations to A/B test:

```

### 2. Problem Agitation Section
**Purpose:** Make the pain of traditional resumes tangible

**Content:**
- "The Resume is Broken" with these pain points:
